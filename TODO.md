# TODO

## Planned Work
1. Clean up unused imports/components on the results page (post email-modal simplification) to silence lint warnings.
2. Smoke-test the leaderboard after alias/filter changes with real survey data to confirm NACE mapping now stays consistent end-to-end.
3. Review production logs once the new deployment has traffic to ensure anonymous alias generation and country/county filters behave as expected.
